0x01-caching

A caching system temporarily stores copies of data (cached data) to speed up access to that data in the future. When a program or device requests data, the system first checks if the data is in the cache. If it's found (a "cache hit"), the data is quickly retrieved from there instead of from the original source. If not found (a "cache miss"), it retrieves the data from the original source and may add it to the cache.
